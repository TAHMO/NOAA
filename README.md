# NOAA Workshop

The primary objective is to equip national meteorological agencies with the skills to access, explore, and apply the high-resolution reanalysis dataset. A specific focus will be on understanding severe weather events, such as extreme rainfall, high winds, and temperature anomalies.<br><br>

## Focus Area 1 — Ground Observations Monitoring &amp; QC
**Core Objective**: To equip NMHS participants with tools for quality-controlling ground station
data and validating it against satellite products, enabling identification of network issues and
building confidence in observational networks. <br>

## Focus Area 2 — Next-Gen Precipitation for Trends & Extremes
**Core Objective**: To compare next-generation precipitation datasets for historical trends,
anomalies, and extreme event performance, enabling NMHS to select optimal products for
climate monitoring and risk assessment.

## Focus Area 3 — Temperature Quality & Microclimates
**Core Objective**: To demonstrate the advantages of high-resolution temperature data in capturing microclimates and computing derived metrics like PET, for better assessment of heat- related risks.
